/* Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice
A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example: */

const cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1);
/* Here splice returns the string London and deletes it from the cities array. cities will have the value ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"]. */

/* Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function. */

function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return cities.slice(0, 3);

  // Only change code above this line
}

const inputCities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
nonMutatingSplice(inputCities); // [ 'Chicago', 'Delhi', 'Islamabad' ]

/* As we saw in the last challenge, the slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects. */

// Ejemplo: la funcion splice() es un metodo destructivo pq modifica el objeto original. Te modifica el array original.

/* Remove Items Using splice():
Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example: */

let array = ["today", "was", "not", "so", "great"];

array.splice(2, 2);
/* Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].

splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements: */

let array2 = ["I", "am", "feeling", "really", "happy"];

let newArray = array2.splice(3, 2);
/* newArray has the value ['really', 'happy'].

/* Add Items Using splice()
Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. */

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);
/* The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].

Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to splice(): The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.

We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places. */

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.splice(0, 2, "DarkSalmon", "BlanchedAlmond");
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(
  htmlColorNames([
    "DarkGoldenRod",
    "WhiteSmoke",
    "LavenderBlush",
    "PaleTurquoise",
    "FireBrick",
  ])
);
